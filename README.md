# QuiqBlog

This is a simple blog web app that I build to practice my C# and ASP.NET skills. It has an eye pleasing UI (User Interface), User authentication and authorization system, and an ability to Createm, Cread, Update, or Delete blog posts.

## How to run

Before proceeding make sure you have `C#` and `.NET Core` installed on your system. Those can be installed via `Visual Studio Installer`. Once you have all of that ready, open `Visual Studio` (Not Visual Studio Code) and follow the steps below.

### Click Open a project or solution
