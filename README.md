# QuiqBlog

This is a simple blog web app that I build to practice my C# and ASP.NET skills. It has an eye pleasing UI (User Interface), User authentication and authorization system, and an ability to Createm, Cread, Update, or Delete blog posts.

## Usage

Before proceeding make sure you have ==C== and ==.NET Core== installed on your system. Those can be installed via `Visual Studio Installer`. Once you have all of that ready, open Visual Studio (Not Visual Studio Code)
